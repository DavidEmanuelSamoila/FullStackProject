This is a mock website that represents a mock consulting company called Royal Consulting.

Royal Consulting is currently working for a computer store to make a website that the employees can use to manage orders, inventory, and more.

The website is found on royal-consulting.ca and it's running on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) running Ubuntu Server v22.04lts. Server is not running at the moment.

I'm using a local MySQL server and to find the Add, Remove, and Edit functionality, go to src/routers/authrouter.js

Go to src/views to see EJS pages

To see how I access the local MySQL server go to src/config/database
